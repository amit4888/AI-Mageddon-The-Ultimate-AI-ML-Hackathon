# 🚀 AI Mageddon: Detection of Zero-Day Exploits Using Anomaly Detection

## 🛡️ Overview
Zero-day exploits pose significant cybersecurity threats by targeting unknown vulnerabilities. Our solution employs **unsupervised deep learning** to model normal system behavior and detect anomalies that may indicate exploit attempts.

## 🔑 Key Components
1. **Unsupervised Learning for Normal Behavior Modeling**  
   - Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for latent representation.
   - Reconstruction error analysis for anomaly detection.

2. **Anomaly Detection & Clustering**  
   - Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN) on latent space.
   - Dynamic thresholding for anomaly classification.

3. **Data Handling & Preprocessing**  
   - Feature engineering for high-dimensional data.
